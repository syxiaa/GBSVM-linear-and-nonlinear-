It is a challenge to calculate granular-balls in high dimensional space. It is unreasonable to directly map the granular-ball GBi(ci, ri) generated in the original space into a high dimensional space, because the radius cannot be directly mapped into a high dimensional space. Another method is to generate granular-balls in the original space and map the points in
each ball into the kernel space to generate new granular-balls. Although the mapped granular-balls contain the same sample points as the original balls, it cannot accurately describe the data set because the mapped data distribution has changed. Generating granular-balls in kernel space is a better solution. Therefore, the final non-linear GBSVM code corresponds to the file "nolinear_GBSVM_keenelGB_last.rar"
